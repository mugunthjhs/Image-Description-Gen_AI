This project is a Streamlit-based web app that uses Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro) to generate descriptions of uploaded images. The user can upload an image file, provide an optional input text, and the app will return a detailed description or response based on the given input and the image.

## Features

- Upload images in various formats such as PNG, JPG, JPEG, and GIF.
- Optionally provide an input text to guide the AI response.
- Uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro model from Google Generative AI to generate descriptions.
- Displays the uploaded image along with the AI-generated response.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: The user can upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or GIF). Once uploaded, the image is displayed in the app.
  
2. **Optional Input**: The user can provide additional text input to guide the AI's response. This input can be a specific question or description related to the image.

3. **AI Model**: The app connects to the Google Generative AI API (Gemini 1.5 Pro model) to process both the image and optional input. The AI generates a detailed description or response.

4. **Response Display**: The AI-generated text is then displayed on the app under the uploaded image. If no input text is provided, the AI describes the image based on its content alone.
